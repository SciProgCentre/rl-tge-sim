# Reactor like TGE model: proof of concept

## 
For fast checking the potential of RL-TGE model, we considered a next simplified model:  
* There is only one tuning parameter --- the local coefficient of gamma multiplication, describing state of the atmosphere (field strength and distribution as well as density);
* The number of produced of photons in a cell follows Poisson distribution, direction of momentum of a generated gamma is defined by the electric field direction;
* Electric field is chaotic: direction of field in cell ignition point is generated by spatial uniform distribution, but magnitude is a constant for the whole cloud;
* Energy of particle is not taken into account, propagation of gamma is simulated with exponential distribution with fixed mean free path;
* Cloud size (meaning the volume with the field) could be varied, but as a reference we take one kilometer cube, we do not track particles outside the field volume. 
## Installation

1. Install JDK one way:
    * From [official Oracle site](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html);
    * Using your packege manager (for exemple, in Debian/Ubuntu use `sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
`);
    * For any Unix use [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/).
2. Clone this repository on your PC using [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) or download this source code as zip-archive.

3. Open terminal and go to the folder with source.

4. Compile program with gradle wrapper:
    * For Windwos 
    * For *nix use`chmod +x gradlew && ./gradlew installDist`
    
    or
    compile program using [Gradle build tools](https://gradle.org/)

We could find the installed program in `./build/install/skysim/bin`
